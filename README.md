# StateKnownForItsFood
Amazon Alexa Skill

Built Alexa Skill for API project for my CSE445: Distributed Software Development class. This skill is not a published Alexa Skill. The skill works after the user opens the skill and Alexa aska the user 'What state food would you like to know?'. Once the user responds with a state name the skill then returns the food name.

Example:

User: 'Alexa, open StateKnownForItsFood.'

Alexa: 'What state food would you like to know?'

User: 'Arizona'

Alexa: 'The food that Arizona is known for is Mexican food.'
